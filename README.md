# Workshop Preparation
Preparation for the "Create a Digital Edition using LEAF Commons" workshop at the University of Cambridge. This workshop runs more smoothly if you a) have a GitHub account, b) have forked the workshop repository, and c) pre-authenticated with LEAF-Writer Commons. On the laptop that you will bring to the workshop do the following steps: 

* To set up a free GitHub account (if you don't already have one):
  * Go to https://github.com and click 'Sign Up' and follow the instructions to register.
  * (If you already have a GitHub account, just log into it before completing the next step.)
* To create a personal fork the repository, once signed in:
  * go to https://github.com/LEAF-VRE/LWC-Cam and click
  * 'Fork' (on the right-hand side near the 'Code' button).
  * This should take you to another page with your username as the default owner and LWC-SAS as the name. These defaults are fine. Click 'Create Fork' at the bottom.
* To pre-authenticate with LEAF-Writer Commons, using the laptop and web browser that you will bring to the workshop:
  * Visit https://leaf-writer.leaf-vre.org/ 
  * Accept all cookies at the bottom
  * Click on 'Sign In With GitHub' on the left-hand side
  * Use your GitHub credentials to log in.
  * You will be asked to authorize our authentication service, “calincs”. This is fine and is used to pass your authentication to GitHub.
  * Once completed you should be able to see your forked 'LWC-SAS' repository under Open 'from the cloud'. You do not need to do anything with it now. 
If you had any difficulty with these steps, we can sort it out at the start of the workshop.
